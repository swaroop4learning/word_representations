# Word Representations
NLP encompasses various tasks - Regression, Classification, Generation. A common
denominator across all these tasks is the question of "how do we convert text into
numbers" so that machines can process them. One way to measure a machine's ability
to “understand” text is Semantic Similarity i.e one should be able to tell you how similar
or dissimilar are a given pair of inputs - and this is the central theme of this task

## About
This repository consists of two parts:<br>
<b>1st part</b>: Possible solutions for word representation tasks. Which would create efficient word representations that would help in performing word similarity, paraphrase and sentence similarities. <br>
<b>2nd part</b>: Paper reading task, where the metric BERTScore is evaluated with pros and cons. And also provided possible improvements for BERTScore metric.
